# Python100DaysOfCoding
100 day python coding challenge

# Prologue
This is my 100 days og coding attempt. Im a SysAdmin student that want to add python to mu reportuar.
My plan is to use this README file as a make shift journal. The thoughts I gather along the way will be written down.
In this rep I will upload my code from day to day. So the first thing I need to do is to re-learn how to upload code to Github.
Wish me luck!
