# Python100DaysOfCoding
100 day python coding challenge

# Prologue
This is my 100 days og coding attempt. Im a SysAdmin student that want to add python to mu reportuar.
My plan is to use this README file as a make shift journal. The thoughts I gather along the way will be written down.
In this rep I will upload my code from day to day. So the first thing I need to do is to re-learn how to upload code to Github.
Wish me luck!



# Day 1
Day one is a very confertable start! Print statement is something I sort of have a hang of!
Looking forward to day 2!

# Day 2
Day two was once again a smooth start. Variables are a straight forward kind of thing. for now.....
The code is simple enough, but I cant wait to see what day 3 has in store for me.

# Day 3
Day three was once again something I kind of knew from before, but I actually learned that you can use "," to combine strings and varaiables, instead of useing "+". So that was nice.
The teacher said that tommorrow is a "project day". Im excited to see what the assignment is. I actually created a little project myself today. a fun little adjective story that you can put in the adjective before the story is told. Then it will put them in. It was kind of cool. Thx to CHAT-GPT for the story text.

# Day 4
It was nice to have a day where I just repeated the concepts I learned and tried to make something with the print statement and variable. As I stated earlier, I kind of knew these concepts from before but experience is always good.

# Day 5
Starting with "if" statements always feel like a kind of milestone. I fell my reportuar increases alot with them. I created my own little project with this lesson where I also threw in a while loop. I think it turned out pretty cool.

# Day 6
Just working more on the extended syntax of if statemnets was pretty cool. I feel like I can do much more with these and create more complex things. I was kind of in a rush this day, so Icopied a bit of the examples as a template but Im very happy with what I got. It was nice to throw in some operators aswell.

# Day 7
This day felt a bit like day 4. And that is a good thing. Not rushing into new concepts, just repeating the previous lessons. When I got the code that I was ment to fix, I imidiatly found what was wrong. That was a good feeling.

# Day 8
Day 8 is another project day! I wanted to test myself a bit! As you can see from my code, I wanted to have the code give a response depending on what you answered, and also have a totally different print if you didnt answer inside the range. It took some figuring out and alot of thinking, but I finally manged to figure it out. Was a fun project and I feel I have a good hang of nesting, if, elif and else statements now.
