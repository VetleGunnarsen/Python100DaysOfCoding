# Python100DaysOfCoding
100 day python coding challenge

# Prologue
This is my 100 days og coding attempt. Im a SysAdmin student that want to add python to mu reportuar.
My plan is to use this README file as a make shift journal. The thoughts I gather along the way will be written down.
In this rep I will upload my code from day to day. So the first thing I need to do is to re-learn how to upload code to Github.
Wish me luck!



# Day 1
Day one is a very confertable start! Print statement is something I sort of have a hang of!
Looking forward to day 2!

# Day 2
Day two was once again a smooth start. Variables are a straight forward kind of thing. for now.....
The code is simple enough, but I cant wait to see what day 3 has in store for me.

# Day 3
Day three was once again something I kind of knew from before, but I actually learned that you can use "," to combine strings and varaiables, instead of useing "+". So that was nice.
The teacher said that tommorrow is a "project day". Im excited to see what the assignment is. I actually created a little project myself today. a fun little adjective story that you can put in the adjective before the story is told. Then it will put them in. It was kind of cool. Thx to CHAT-GPT for the story text.
